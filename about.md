I'm a passionate, rigorous and senior software engineer.

I focus on writing clean, highly performant and maintainable code.

I apply the best practices like Design Patterns, SOLID Principles and some other principles like DRY, KISS, YAGNI etc.

Tests is a very important step in my software development.
I practice TDD and BDD in my daily work, and I write a lot of Non-Regression tests.
Strong software consists of well tested code and is technical debt free.

With more than 10 years' professional experiences, I've worked in differenct programming languages like PHP, C# and Java. And I work principally in C# .NET since 2010. 
I've worked a lot on technologies like Windows Communication Framework, Windows Presentation Framework, ASP.NET Web Forms, ASP.NET MVC, Entity Framework, and ASP.NET Web API.
And I work on Angular, TypeScript, ASP.NET core, .NET core in the recent years.

I work a lot on Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment with tools like XL Deploy, TeamCity, TFS and Jenkins.

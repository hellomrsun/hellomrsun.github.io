If you have met this exception:

```batch
Could not load file or assembly '{Library_Name}, Version=0.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken={Token}' or one of its dependencies. Tentative de chargement dâ€™un programme de format incorrect. 
```

It means the dll that you have referenced is not compatible with your project's build configuration likePlatform, or Platform target. 

<!--more-->

If your the reference library is 32 bit, you need to make sure your platform and platform target is **x86**.


If your the reference library is 64 bit, you can configure the platform and platform target as **Any CPU**.

Once all these information are consistent, try to rebuild and rerun the project. :)



Enjoy coding!

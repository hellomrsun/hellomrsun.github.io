If you have met this exception:

```batch
Could not load file or assembly '{Library_Name}, Version=0.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken={Token}' or one of its dependencies. Tentative de chargement dâ€™un programme de format incorrect. 
```

It means the dll that you have referenced is not compatible with your project's build configuration likePlatform, or Platform target. 


If your the reference library is 32 bit, you need to make sure your platform and platform target is **x86**.


If your the reference library is 64 bit, you can configure the platform and platform target as **Any CPU**.

Once all these information are consistent, try to rebuild and rerun the project. :)



Enjoy coding!

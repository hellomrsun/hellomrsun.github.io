I've got the [**70-483: Programming in C#**](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/exam-70-483.aspx) certification several years ago, but I didn't go further to get more Microsoft certifications then. 

As I've started this new technical blog, why not to continue the certification path?

So as a fullstack .NET developer, the next certification would be [**70-486:Developing ASP.NET MVC Web Applications**](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/exam-70-486.aspx) to become a [**MCSA**](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/mcsa-web-applications-certification.aspx) (Microsoft Certified Solutions Associate) on Web Applications.

* Design the application architecture (15-20%)
* Design the build and deployment architecture (10-15%)
* Design the User Experience (15-20%)
* Develop the User Experience (15-20%)
* Troubleshoot and Debug Web Applications (20-25%)
* Design and Implement Security (15-20%)

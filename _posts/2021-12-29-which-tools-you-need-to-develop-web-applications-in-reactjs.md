### Tools:
- Visual studio code
- Chrome

<br/>

### Visual studio code extensions:

- Auto Import

This extension will propose to import the related type you add in your file.
It works for scripts developed in TypeScript and TSX.

- Auto Import - ES6, TX, JSX, TSX 

This extension not only works for scripts developed in TypesScript, TSX, but also for scripts developed in **JSX**.

<br/>

- ESLint

ESLint is a tool for identifying and reporting on patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code, with the goal of making code more consistent and avoiding bugs.

ESLint supports **Javascript** code and **TypeScript** code, whereas TSLint only supports TypeScript code.

ESLint uses Espree for JavaScript parsing.
ESLint uses an AST to evaluate patterns in code.
ESLint is completely pluggable, every single rule is a plugin and you can add more at runtime.

You can check the [rules](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/){:target="_blank"} proposed by ESLint.

<br/>

- Reactjs code snippets

ReactJs code snippets will facilitate your development by providing a lot of shortcuts to create sample codes.

- Redux DevTools

You can check the redux workflow in React applications developed with Redux.

And you can verify the state changes in each step of the redux workflow.

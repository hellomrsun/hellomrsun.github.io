It’s the third year I’ve participated the Microsoft Techdays at Paris. There are always a lot of people who come from all over the France. And I’ve also heared people speaking english in one session I’ve participated today.

It’s always a good experience to find out there are so many peers working on Microsoft technologies. Since Microsoft are making its frameworks and libraries open source, there will surely be more people embracing Microsoft technologies.
